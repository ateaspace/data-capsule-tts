### [IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet)

An alphabetic system of phonetic notation. Designed to represent qualities of speech that are part of lexical (and to a limited extent prosodic) sounds in oral language: phones, phonemes, intonation and the separation of words and syllables.

### [Phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_(phonetics))

Any distinct speech sound or gesture. Language and word-meaning independent. Generally vowels or consonants.

A phonetic transcription (based on phones) is enclosed with square brackets ([ ]).

### [Phoneme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme)

A unit of sound that distinguishes one word from another in a particular language. Can also be though of as a sound pattern.

A phonemic transcription (based on phonemes) is enclosed with slashes (/ /).

### [Vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel)

A phone that is produced without any stricture in the vocal tract. A good way to think of it is as a frictionless, continuous sound - you can keep making the sound forever.

### [Consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant)

A speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. For example, \[p\] is  pronounced with the lips, \[t\] with the front of the toungue. The sound cannot be produced continuously.

### [Syllable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable)

A unit of organization for a sequence of phones. It is typically made up of a syllable nucleus (most often a vowel) with optional initial and final margins (typically, consonants). Syllables are often considered the phonological "building blocks" of words.

In the IPA, a period (.) is used to mark syllable breaks. E.g. in the word "astronomical" ⟨/ˌæs.trəˈnɒm.ɪk.əl/⟩.

### Open Syllable Language

Where all syllables end in a vowel.

### Monophthong

A vowel sound, in which the tongue stays in one position.

Monophthongs are transcribed with one symbol, as in English sun [sʌn].

### [Diphthong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong)

Literally "double sounds". Sometimes known as a gliding vowel. A diphthong is a combination of two adjacent vowel sounds within the same syllable. Technically, a diphthong is a vowel with two different targets - the tongue moves during the pronunciation of the vowel.

Diphthongs are transcribed with two symbols, as in English high [haɪ] or cow [kaʊ], in which ⟨aɪ⟩ and ⟨aʊ⟩ represent diphthongs.

### [Hiatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatus_(linguistics))

The result of two vowel sounds occuring in adjacent syllables, with no intervening consonant.

### [Consonant Cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant_cluster)

A consonant cluster, sequence or compound group of consonants that have no intervening vowel. In English, for example, the groups /spl/ and /ts/ are consonant clusters in the word splits.

### Digraph

A digraph or digram is a pair of characters used in the orthography of a language to write either a single phoneme, or a sequence of phnemes that does not correspond to the normal values of the two characters combined.

### Fricative

### [Semivowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semivowel)

A semivowel or glide is a sound that is phonetically similar to a vowel sound but functions as the syllable boundary, rather than as the nucleus of a syllable. Examples of semivowels in English are the consonants y and w, in yes and west, respectively. Written /j w/ in IPA

### [Grapheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme)

The smallest functional unit of a writing system.

There are two main opposing grapheme concepts. In the so-called referential conception, graphemes are interpreted as the smallest units of writing that correspond with phonemes. In this concept, the sh in the written English word shake would be a grapheme because it represents the phoneme ʃ. This referential concept is linked to the dependency hypothesis that claims that writing merely depicts speech. By contrast, the analogical concept defines graphemes analogously to phonemes, i.e. via written minimal pairs such as shake vs. snake. In this example, h and n are graphemes because they distinguish two words. This analogical concept is associated with the autonomy hypothesis which holds that writing is a system in its own right and should be studied independently from speech. Both concepts have weaknesses.

Some models adhere to both concepts simultaneously by including two individual units, which are given names such as graphemic grapheme for the grapheme according to the analogical conception (h in shake), and phonological-fit grapheme for the grapheme according to the referential concept (sh in shake).

In newer concepts, in which the grapheme is interpreted semiotically as a dyadic linguistic sign, it is defined as a minimal unit of writing that is both lexically distinctive and corresponds with a linguistic unit (phoneme, syllable, or morpheme).

Graphemes are often notated within angle brackets: ⟨a⟩, ⟨B⟩, etc. This is analogous to both the slash notation (/a/, /b/) used for phonemes, and the square bracket notation used for phonetic transcriptions ([a], [b]).
