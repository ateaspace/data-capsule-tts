He mana t\u014d te reo, he ihi t\u014d te reo, he tapu t\u014d te reo. He wairua t\u014d te reo, he mauri an\u014d t\u014d te reo. M\u0101 te wairua ka rangona te reo, m\u0101 te mauri ka mana ai te reo.

N\u014d reira, ko te reo tapu he tohu mana n\u014d te tangata, he mana t\u016bturu n\u014d te atua, e kore e whakap\u014dreareatia e te tangata k\u0113 (Barlow 1991:112).\n Reo-\u0101-iwi.\nHe rerek\u0113 te tangi me te mita o te reo o ia iwi, o ia iwi, o ia iwi; hei tauira, he rerek\u0113 te tangi mai o te reo o Waikato ki t\u0113r\u0101 o Te Wai-pounamu. N\u0101 Te Manihera (R.

    "He P\u016branga t\u0113nei o te wh\u0101rangi k\u014drero o te Hau K\u0101inga.\nSome of these comments could be just as good or better on our general talk page.  Anyone who likes can copy to there; but Hau K\u0101inga is a good page to look at when thinking about these points.\n Te in page names.\nSome readers may have noticed in my recent page history comment that I was wondering whether page names should include Te.\nOnly one of our articles currently does (te reo Maori); but a great many of the links in Hau K\u0101inga are looking to create pages starting with Te. \nHere are some reasons AGAINST:\nRobin Patterson 03:12, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n:I think you're probably right - it makes sense not to include te. -- Vardion 02:28, 1 May 2004 (UTC)\nKa pai! Thanks for dropping by and adding to your already long list of contributions. You may notice I already excluded most of the te from the links. Robin Patterson 11:38, 1 May 2004 (UTC)\n Coloured boxes.\nRobin here again. Can someone (preferably the person who composed or translated the heading) explain the meaning - and perhaps the envisaged long-term scope - of Iwi Wh\u0101nui (so that some of us can get a better idea of whether it might be just as good underneath the much bigger box)? It looks a bit small since I moved the stuff that didn't relate to this M\u0101ori Wikipedia. 202.27.88.100 06:38, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n:(Sorry about the slow response - I didn't notice this question...). I intended Iwi Wh\u0101nui to mean community, as in the Wikipedia community. Whether I've used the term in the proper context, I'm not entirely certain. The box was based on the equivalent one on the old English Wikipedia main page, which served much the same function as the new Community Portal page. -- Vardion 02:28, 1 May 2004 (UTC)\nE pai ana, e hoa! I had worked out that you probably meant something like that (which means my translation sources must agree with yours). I'm considering moving it too, to go BELOW the specifically NZ material, so that the NZ columns have more room to display and expand. We have such a swag of material there, with scope for much more, and those specifically Maori subjects are what most of our serious visitors will have come to see - not the general Wikipedia links. I would be pleased if you decided to move it there, because you are far more used to tables than I am! \nNow I hope you and less frequent visitors have a glance at most of the new additions and changes, with a harder look at some of them. Kind regards - Robin Patterson 11:38, 1 May 2004 (UTC)\n New Meta page - List of articles all languages should have.\nHi. I dont know if this is the right place to post this, but you may want to see our new Meta page: List of articles all languages should have. It is intended to give a boost to the smaller languages. Hope it helps. 64.12.116.12 20:27, 29 May 2004 (UTC)\n:OK, had a look. Impressive list, which could be a handy checklist. But it's not finished yet, so we had better revisit the Meta page from time to time. The Latin WP has made a copy, which is in the process of being translated (with Simple English visible as links.) - Robin Patterson 08:40, 3 Jun 2004 (UTC)\nContacting speakers; contributions from learners.\nHi, has anyone contacted any of the grassroots organizations yet?  Just curious.  Though I imagine even a sort of simple Maori (i.e. Maori composed using available vocabulary) written by young learners would be useful.  67.242.13.42 17:02, 9 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n:Yes, I have (as mentioned on the Korero page) communicated in one way or another with Maori TV, the Maori Language Commission, CommunityNet, and several tribal websites or  guestbooks. More approaches planned. Also mentioned it to all or most NZ members of the English Wikipedia. And as a new though old learner I've contributed about 95% of the articles. Ever hopeful of getting significant contributions from more than the current handful of contributors who know more than I do. Kia ora koe. Robin Patterson 22:40, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)\nRemoval of M\u0101ori-language content from the main page (and elsewhere).\nI'm not prepared to allow it unless it is replaced in the same edit by better-quality M\u0101ori material. Robin Patterson 11:37, 10 July 2005 (UTC)\n Revert of node_ue's changes.\nHi Robin, hi node_ue,\nI have reverted the two changes by node_ue.\n1) concerning the position of the English intro: \n1.1) I firmly believe that it is up to the mi team to decide where to place this invitation for English-speaking people. Unfortunately the majority of ethnic Maoris do not speak their own language well. Besides Maori is official language in New Zealand, and we have to assume that a \n:Yes, that is certainly true, but this Wikipedia is for people who DO speak Maori, not just everyone of a Maori ethnic background.\ngreat number of people from New Zealand with non-Maori background will just come around to have a look. From what I know, at least a bit of Maori is taught to everyone in NZ at school. So node_ue, you do not have to be the language police here. Just leave it up to true Kiwis to decide where to put this. So far I have not seen any complaints about the mi main page, apart from you, who are neither Maori nor Kiwi.\n:Why should being from Germany give you any more authority than me, if you're not Maori? And if being from New Zealand is such a big deal, why is Rocastelo a sysop, hailing from Galicia in Spain? And why do you presume so much authority, being in Hamburg? \n1.2) While it might be arguable, whether or not the English invitation deserves the first line, I think that it is definitely out of place where node placed it. It is below a longer paragraph in English. I think a good place would be an info box in a right column. But I do not want to \n:I don't think it's arguable. I think it DEFINITELY doesn't belong on the first line. I just didn't want to remove it altogether because I knew Robin Patterson would have a fit.\ninterfere with that. Let us just leave that for the Maori team to decide. And node: you and I do not belong to this team. So just leave them in peace.\n:Please see Template:Stub which I recently improved. What are your contributions here? What are your qualifications? Is your Maori any better than mine? Are you Maori? Or are you a white guy who can't speak very much Maori at all, and who likes to think he's more qualified than others just because he's from Germany?? And if I have no business here, what business do you have here Heiko? Why don't you go work on the Low Saxon Wikipedia?\n:Also, I find your view of Wikipedia communities as exclusive and impenetrable laughable and at the same time very offensive. The whole point of Wikipedia is collaboration, not saying Ha ha ha! You can't join!.\n2) Concerning the Macron-edit:\n2.1) node, your version has added two links, one to Haere mai and one to Wikipedia. But these two pages do not exist so far. Of course a page about Wikipedia will eventually be written. But we \n:So what? That's what redlinks are for. So that people will make the pages there.\ndo not know whether the mi team will have a separate page Haere mai, which (as far as I know) means welcome. So I think it would have been better in this case to wait until such a page exists before it is linked to. \n:Why wouldn't we have one here? Most other Wikipedias have one. I think that we, as a community striving to build a Maori-language Wikipedia, are desparately in need of a good welcome page in Maori that explains who we are, what we are all about, and how to edit Wikipedia. Redlinks are an invitation for the creation of such pages.\n2.2) the macron-text was inside a comment, so it is not visible and it did not annoy anyone but the language police. For someone who was blocked for a week here, node, I think that this is not a good restart for you here.\n:Heiko, in case you didn't notice, the exact same text is reproduced in MediaWiki:Copyrightwarning and so the comment on each page has been rendered obsolete. Currently, it's a waste of space.\nMy proposition to node: before making any further changes in any article, you should propose your changes in a *friendly* way on the corresponding talk page. Otherwise I fear you are in danger of getting a much, much longer blocking here.\n:My proposition to you, Heiko: either join a community, or stay out, but don't sit on the fence telling people they can't come in when you aren't really even in yourself.\nMy proposition to Robin: write protect the main page. You have had trouble enough about it. Everyone would still be able to leave comments in the talk page.\nMY* proposition to Robin: Revert Heiko Evermann's changes, or at least unprotect the page. mi.wiki is relatively low-traffic, explicit vandalism to the mainpage is generally fixed very quickly and doesn't happen very often at that. As a Wikipedia page, the whole point is for it to be editable by everyone. Sure, there may be some edit conflicts, but unless it degenerates into a full-scale edit war, protection is unreasonable.\n:For examples of relatively large Wikipedias that don't have protected mainpages for the very reasons I gave above: Estonian, with over 10700 articles; Korean, with over 11700 articles; Ukrainian, with over 19100 articles... Compared to the less than 1000 articles on the Maori Wikipedia, don't you think that it's a bit unreasonable for us to have a protected mainpage? You may think these people never deal with revert wars or vandalism but in fact they do. They are just very committed to the spirit of Wikipedia. --Node ue\nNode_ue since you're from Arizona you shouldn't be putting others down for being from where they come from. But since they are here they must be interested in the Maori language as well. Concerning  the protecting of the main page, it is interesting to note that you seem to be in the habit of deleting content from the Ladino wikipedia, to the extent that it could be considered vandalism. Auxilingua\n:Auxilingua, I notice you have a sort of ongoing campaign of slander against me at various Wikipedias. You seem to like to tell people that I have vandalised lad.wp. Well, I have not. And besides, you don't have much of a position there -- you're sysop why, because your buddy from ia.wp, Jay, made you one? Because of course, we all know you're from Turkey/Israel/Morocco. --Node ue 15:42, 28 Whiringa-\u0101-nuku 2006 (UTC)\nDeprecated project.\nKia ora. Please remove the link to sep11.wikipedia.org from your main page. It is no longer supposed to be linked to (check 95% of the other Wikipedias, including en:). Thank you. 11:30, 20 August 2005 (UTC)\nIdo language.\n Redesign.\nDoes any one agree that the main page needs a redesign? I would have a go at it, but I'm just any ordinary user (need admin access to edit the main page).\nHeoi an\u014d; n\u0101 Brian New Zealand 09:24, 15 December 2005 (UTC)\n: I had a quick go  see here for my design, if no one objects to it by the 18 December, I'll put it live (since my last post I have been made an admin)\n:Heoi an\u014d; n\u0101 Brian New Zealand 23:34, 15 December 2005 (UTC)\nSee my final proposed redesign HERE, Heoi an\u014d; n\u0101 Brian  (talk) 19:01, 17 December 2005 (UTC)\n:I Retreat, as User:Robin Patterson pointed out, their are, a few bugs to work thru.

Robin Patterson 21:27, 20 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)\nPukapuka Taki P\u0101tauranga was a typo.\nI looked at  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page_alternate_%28Classic_2004%29 - the en. Wiki main page as of 2004 and realised that that was the basis of our Hau K\u0101inga page. The headings equivalent to our 'Pukapuka Taki P\u0101tauranga' and 'Iwi Wh\u0101nui' were 'Encyclopedia' and 'Community.' I retranslated Community, since Iwi Wh\u0101nui isnt quite right for that. Then I looked up 'Encyclopedia' in various M. dictionaries, and in the Ngata dictionary it is 'Pukapuka Taki M\u0101tauranga'. So that explains where the mystery P\u0101tauranga came from - a typo!!!  I retranslated that heading as M\u0101t\u0101punenga (encyclopedia) in accordance with what we call ourselves. I also replaced the obscure (but in the dictionary) Kohuku meaning unfinished with the plainer and more comprehensible 'hei whakaoti' 'to be completed'.  Kahuroa 18:35, 14 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)\nRevamped main page.\nGreat stuff! Now I wonder whether \u0100whina mai - whakam\u0101oritia! is the best starter. We seem to have lost the invitation for first-time visitors to browse and LEARN something. A recent version had the heading Akona followed by Hei tauira, titiro koa ki \u0113nei wh\u0101rangi papai: ...; and the sitenotice mentioned the idea of learning too. Most visitors are unlikely to contribute directly but may turn into devotees and ambassadors if they like what they read. Robin Patterson 19:33, 19 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)\n:T\u0113n\u0101. Shifted stuff around - have to keep a rough balance (in the amount of content) between the two columns as well - how's that. Kahuroa 04:28, 20 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)\nTino pai! I've just printed a copy (regrettably not in colour) and pinned it to the second-floor kitchenette noticeboard in Guardian Trust House, Poneke. Interesting to see that the printable version put only a single line of print to the right of the image then resumed at the bottom. Perfectly legible though. Ka kite, e hoa. Robin Patterson 19:11, 20 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)\nFloating logos/icons.\nBother! The printed version has a more serious error: the logos for the sister projects float up to near the top of the page (p2) instead of sitting in their boxes. We need an image expert. BrianNZ?? (An alternative could be to put those on another page altogether.) Robin Patterson 21:27, 20 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)\n:See what BrianNZ has to say - otherwise I've got a mate I could ask Kahuroa 22:56, 20 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)\nAs soon as I'm at a printer (or as soon as my new ink arrives) , I'll have a look. (The the printable version link makes it look okay) Heoi an\u014d; n\u0101 Brian  (talk) 23:42, 20 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)\n: it looks ok on my system. Text beside image ok, not broken up into different sections. No floating icons. The left column is a bit skinnier than the right one, but otherwise ok. Kahuroa 08:03, 21 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)\n::I printed it and it looks okay for me. The only complaint is the left column is smaller than the right one.

When I click for the printable version now, the logos for Ng\u0101 p\u016btere k\u014dp\u016btahi display floating at the top of the page, so I'm not even going to try printing again. Maybe it's time for Kahuroa's mate to come on board? Or User:Grutness, another image expert? Robin Patterson 21:18, 21 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)\n": {

Robin Patterson 23:18, 21 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)\n:Ha, I just got an email from my mate, he's doing a big OE in Montreal so probably wouldn't want to get involved! Sorry. It's actually more likely to be a minor error in the table code than anything to do with images per se. Anyway I'll redo the whole page over the next week or so, testing it on my user page.

My display is back to how it should be but the actual print of the printable version still floats the dear little beggars to the top of their page. I may try temporary solution: Give that section its own page, with links from main (so that our initial presentation is closer to flawless) and portal. Robin Patterson 21:15, 22 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)\nLogo (moko).\nThe  Wikipedia The Free Encyclopedia image at the top left of the page should be translated into M\u0101ori too. 2006-02-21 09:07:03 203.109.164.4\n:Kia ora! People have been giving some thought to that. Not top priority yet. See Wikipedia:K\u014drero/2005c. Robin Patterson 21:27, 20 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)\n Te Matatiki has a much better word for logo: waitohu. And the page could be called Waitohu o Wikipedia - funny without the 'o'.  BTW Any thought been given to the transliteration of Wikipedia, since there is no d in the M alphabet?

Robin Patterson 20:33, 19 Pout\u016b-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)\nDone a few little ones. I suppose I could list the bigger ones here for perusal. That will have to wait till lunchtime. Robin Patterson 22:34, 19 Pout\u016b-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)\n(Sorry, got tied up. And no PC at home just now.)\n:One important thing we need to do to improve the functionality and attractiveness of the main page is to to reduce the number of links in each section. There should be a limit as to how many there are. Too many is overkill. Kahuroa 00:25, 21 Pout\u016b-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)\n::Well, maybe you should have removed those italicised links instead of just restoring their otherwise unexplained disorder (alphabetically). Cut away! Robin Patterson 01:31, 21 Pout\u016b-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)\nMost or all of the Wikipedia reo k\u0113 appear elsewhere on the page. I'd be quite happy to lose all of the ones that don't have the justification of a Maori translation. Robin Patterson 01:31, 21 Pout\u016b-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)\nI think we could do without the sister projects; some other page, OK, but I see no value in having them on our main page. Robin Patterson 01:31, 21 Pout\u016b-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)\n:Please don't delete the sisters. Their value is in the colour and graphic elements they introduce. Removing them will return the main page to its bleak former state - a bland boring collection of links. Kahuroa 19:42, 21 Pout\u016b-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)\nI also have plans to remove 70% of the English content: everything starting from There are at least ... - that may please some of you! Most of what's virtually repeated on the Tomokanga hapori is unnecessary on the front page. Robin Patterson 01:31, 21 Pout\u016b-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)\n: Like your ideas re the main page - I just had to do a temporary reversion since the placement of the welcome line (in Maori) upset the format by introducing a line of colour above the heading. Once I fixed that I expanded the welcome line into a paragraph and moved some of the Maori content to the other column to keep it balanced and then tried to recreate your changes such as the removal of the extra English content (the inclusion of which wasn't my idea in the first place by the way). Many thanks!! Kahuroa 10:57, 23 Pout\u016b-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)\nGood recent reshuffle, Kahuroa. I had been thinking that the T\u012bmata p\u0113nei was a little premature near the top left, inviting response start what? - so your moving it to the other column and renaming is great. I had a feeling there was scope for integrating that para and the following one, but only a fluent speaker could start on that sort of task! Robin Patterson 20:25, 23 Pout\u016b-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)\nShould the t\u0101one nui be a subsection of Aotearoa? Maybe replace at the bottom with a short Whenua me t\u0101one o te Ao? Robin Patterson 20:25, 23 Pout\u016b-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)\n:Sure - tho I'd prefer we called the new short section Ao wh\u0101nui as a catch all for overseas stuff. Kahuroa 00:17, 24 Pout\u016b-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)\nMoved the towns without replacement, a few days ago. Problem with Ao wh\u0101nui is that the other sections belong in it too, don't they? How about T\u0101one nui o te Ao (ie anything bigger than Akarana)? Robin Patterson 03:42, 10 Paenga-wh\u0101wh\u0101 2006 (UTC)\n:Comment: We have a section Aotearoa. That is, NZ. I was suggesting another section Ao wh\u0101nui = rest of world/wider world. Then you could have a subsection under that  Taone nui   Kahuroa 06:20, 10 Paenga-wh\u0101wh\u0101 2006 (UTC)\n::But doesn't Ao wh\u0101nui include the whole world, not just the rest of the world? And it includes tikanga and t\u0101ngata? Robin Patterson 20:20, 10 Paenga-wh\u0101wh\u0101 2006 (UTC)\n:::Not when it is contrasted with Aotearoa. You seem to have a different understanding of wh\u0101nui. Ao wh\u0101nui = the wide world. I like it, there's nothing wrong with it. Alternative is 'Whenua k\u0113'. (Whenua me taone...' is a bit anglified).Kahuroa 00:12, 11 Paenga-wh\u0101wh\u0101 2006 (UTC)\nThat image that just went up is nice, well done! :) Heoi an\u014d; n\u0101 Brian  (talk) 00:25, 9 Paenga-wh\u0101wh\u0101 2006 (UTC)\nFor better column balance, how about moving Akona: he wh\u0101rangi papai hei tauira to right-hand column? Robin Patterson 03:42, 10 Paenga-wh\u0101wh\u0101 2006 (UTC)\n:Comment:Wouldn't that make it worse? The left-hand column has a little less in it than the right as it is. Or do you mean something else by balance? Kahuroa 05:58, 10 Paenga-wh\u0101wh\u0101 2006 (UTC)\nThat's interesting - on my display in Cologne Blue skin the left-hand is longer: weta is in line with YahooNews. Maybe it's time I left that page alone and tried to add some more real content. Robin Patterson 20:20, 10 Paenga-wh\u0101wh\u0101 2006 (UTC)\n:Naku i whakatakoto \u0113tahi o \u014d whakaaro. Pai ake. Kia ora. Kahuroa 10:24, 18 Haratua 2006 (UTC)\n Revisions.\nDear Maori Wikipedians, I really enjoyed those revisions, they seemed to give it a more ethnic feel.  I particularly liked the english box, as I think that ought to be a lot more ecumenical than the straight Maori look the last one had.  Sure hope this place can get more sites.  Cheers! Sincerely, 68.253.218.140 05:38, 23 Haratua 2006 (UTC)\nQuality.\nI think we need to apply some criteria to the pages used as examples etc, especially those cited as wh\u0101rangi papai.\nWill be gradually implementing this. Kahuroa 23:10, 4 Pipiri 2006 (UTC)\nKa pai. Several of the links in the wh\u0101rangi papai are now so much poorer than the best of the recent additions that I would be pleased if you would either improve them or delete them from that list. Fifteen excellent pages would be better than 15 excellent plus six patchy. (Slightly different criteria should apply to the formerly-matching list in the Wikipedia:Tomokanga hapori, because of its different target audience, but your improvements would be most welcome for pages listed there too). Robin Patterson 03:55, 12 Pipiri 2006 (UTC)\n Link to Macedonian Wiki.\nKia ora! I  am an administrator from the Macedonian Wiki and I see that you have only some languages listed directly at the bottom of the page and I was wondering if you could put the Macedonian Wiki there as well (in case you don't have some special criteria for that). Should you decide to accept it, the code should look like this: '. The original name of the language in the latin alphabet is Makedonski. I don't know whether you will transliterate it into M\u0101ori from the English name or directly from the original. I leave that to you. All best and thanks a lot. \u0411. \u0408\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0443\u043b\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0438\nKia ora an\u014d koe - n\u0101ku nei i \u0101piti Kahuroa 19:20, 11 Pipiri 2006 (UTC)\nMore revamp?.\n(First para copied from what Kahuroa wrote elsewhere.)\nI would like to reformat the page. To do it I need all the articles under 'Awa' or 'X' to be in the category 'Awa' or 'X' and for the Awa catpage or the 'X' catpage to have been created. It's daunting to have to do everything before you can start things. Kahuroa 19:29, 13 Pipiri 2006 (UTC)\n:Excellent idea. I thought we had a :category:awa but with very little in it. Maybe not. And several other subjects that would be ideal for such a revamp are definitely not categories yet. I'm happy to help in both aspects of that, but it needs a mi-3 to decide what the names of the categories should be. Robin Patterson 20:34, 13 Pipiri 2006 (UTC)\nOK - what about the titles of the subsections on the left side - like Ao M\u0101ori, Tikanga-\u0101-iwi, P\u016btaiao - I did Maunga already or most of them - some of them may be cats already but the articles havent been tagged in some cases. Kahuroa 00:07, 14 Pipiri 2006 (UTC)\n:Great start; I'll see if I can get something usable before heading for home tonight. Robin Patterson 00:56, 14 Pipiri 2006 (UTC)\n Nice.\nHave not viewed mi for a while. The mainpage looks Kai Pai! 125.236.44.44 03:13, 16 Pipiri 2006 (UTC)\n:It does indeed - good work Kahuroa et al!

Engari kua riro ano te mana o tenei kaunihere i te tau 1899, a i 1903 kua korengia te mana o taua roopu.\nI 1940 tokomaha nga tangata maohi i uru ki te pakanga nui i Uropi ara WWII.\nI te tau 1946 i tapina ko Poronihia W\u012bw\u012b he taiwhenua tawahi o W\u012bw\u012b, ara kua tu he paremata taiwhenua a ka taea e ratou te tuku i tetehi tangata noa hei mangai mo ratou ki te Paremata nui ki W\u012bw\u012b. I 1957 i whanuitia te mana o te paremata taiwhenua. \n Tahiti mo Tahiti.\nHei ahakoa te maunga o W\u012bw\u012b i nga Kahui moutere nei ka whawhai tonu nga tangata maohi ra kia tu rangatira ano ratou.\nI te tau 1947 i tu rangatira ano ko Pouvanaa Tetuaapua Oopa me nga tangata karawhiu i te whakapehi o W\u012bw\u012b. Kua aukatihia tetehi kaipuke no W\u012bw\u012b. Kua mauheretia e te pirihimana engari i te tau 1949 i tautokohia te tangata hei mema o te paremata taiwhenua, a, i te tau 1951 ko tona roopu te mea nui o taua paremata taiwhenua a ko Pouvanaa Oopa te tumuaki tuarua. \nKo te kaupapa nui o Pouvanaa me ona hoa tautoko ko Tahiti mo Tahiti ara Tahiti for the Tahitians ... Vote NO so that the enslaving yoke will be quickly removed from around our necks'\nI mauheretia ano Pouvanaa Tetuaapua Oopa nei a kua tapaina tona roopu tautoko he mea ture-kore e te paremata nui ki W\u012bw\u012b.

I 1975 i nekehia te whakapahupahu nei ki Fangataufa. Ka tu nga tangata maohi me etehi o nga tangata o te ao kia aukati te mahi tukino nei.\nI te tau 1975 i tu rangatira ano a Oscar Temaru me tona roopu torangapu a Tavini Huiraatira, e toru noa o ratou karanga ki tu rangatira te whenua o Tahiti ra, kia aukati te pahu o te pahu karihi o W\u012bw\u012b, me te tohatoha pai i nga hua o te whenua. \n Te Raru o te Paremata.\nI te tau 2004 ka tu tautohe ano nga tangata na te nui o nga utu mo nga hua o te whenua me nga take pera. I te 15 o Pipiri 2004 i potihia a Oscar Temaru hei Tumuaki o Poronihia W\u012bw\u012b, kua hinga ke te Tumuaki o mua ko Gaston Flosse. \nEngari ka kore e whakaae e te paremata (poti 27-28), a na Gaston Flosse i tono ki te Paremata matua ki W\u012bw\u012b kia whakahaere tetehi poti hou mona.\nI tautokohia ano a Oscar Temaru i te tau 2006 kia tu hei pirihitane. Engari i te 13 o Hakihea 2006 kua whakakorengia ano e te paremata taiwhenua a kua pana.\nKua tu a Gaston Tong Sang hei Pirihitane i te 26 Hakihea 2006, engari i pana ano e te Paremata i te 31 o Hereturikoka 2007.

It was sad to the verge of tears. I felt a profound regret, a regret for-I knew not what. Was it for the beating of the temple drums or the shouting of the populace as the king was raised on high? Was it for the human sacrifices of olden times? It was for none of these individually but for something at the back of them all, some living spirit and divine courage that existed in ancient times of which Taputapu-atea was a mute symbol. It was something that we Polynesians have lost and cannot find, something that we yearn for and cannot recreate. The background in which that spirit was engendered has changed beyond recovery. The bleak wind of oblivion had swept over Opoa. Foreign weeds grew over the untended courtyard, and stones had fallen from the sacred altar of Taputapu-atea. The gods had long ago departed. (Buck 1938, 81-82)\nKa roa ka penei te ahua ka tangi noa nga manu i runga o Taputapuatea.\nHei ahakoa i te tau 1976 i hoki ano mai a Hokulea o Hawaii ki Raiatea a ka tau atu ratou ki Taputapuatea. Ka whakatau ano ratou ki te marae ra engari ka tu tetehi tangata ko Parau Rahi te ingoa kohetehete noa i a ratou, notemea i uru mai a Hokulea ma Avarua ehara ma Avamoa, te awa tapu    \nKatahi ra ka puta te whakaaro ki te ngakau o etehi kia hoki ano mai nga waka kia hiki te tapu i Avamoa. Ko Pierre Sham Koua o Raiatea tetehi tangata kaha rawa kia tutuki pai i tenei kaupapa\nI te tau 1995 i rau mai nga kahui waka hourua mai i Hawaii, i Aotearoa, i Rarotonga me Tahiti ki Avamoa mo te Faatau aroha i Taputapuatea.\nKo tenei rau waka te whakahokinga mai o nga whakatere waka o te Moananui a Kiwa ki tenei marae tapu, he timatanga ano mo te wahi nei ki tu hei Marae Tapu no te Ao.\nKo Te Aurere o Aoteroa te waka tuatahi kia tomo ano mai ki Avamoa. Ka karakia haeremai te waka nei kia hiki te tapu kua takotoria i te Hara i Awarua, a ma penei ka tu ano te ara tapu i Taputapuatea kia tu ano te Fa'atau Aroha.\n Te Marae Tapu no te Ao.\nKua whakahoutia ano te marae Taputapuatea nei e ona uri ki Opoa. A Kua whakaturia tetehi roopu ko Na Papa e Vau hei kaitiaki mona. Ko tetehi tikanga nui ma ratou kia tohua te Marae Taputapuatea nei hei World Heritage Site i raro i te kawenata o Unesco.\nKoia ra i te 12 Hepetema 2007 i hui ano nga ariki o te Moananui a Kiwa ki Taputapuatea kia korerohia o ratou ake take. I hui mai nga kahui ariki o Tahiti Nui, o Tonga, o Hamoa, o Hawaii, o Rarotonga. Ko Tuheitia te kingi maori, me Te Heuheu ariki o Ngati Tuwharetoa nga mea i ahu mai i Aotearoa nei.\nI te 24 o Mahuru 2007 i hainatia tetehi tatau pounamu (he Natira'a ki to te reo o Tahiti Nui) i waenganui i te Marae Taputapuatea me nga piringa marae o Ngati Tuwharetoa. Ko te hainatanga tuatahi penei kia whakahonore te kaupapa kia tautapa Marae Taputapuatea hei Marae tapu no te Ao katoa.\n": {

I am dealing with the Project Management of the Fundraiser 2007 and therefore will search for contacts of wikimedians who can help us to do our tasks on all projects. I am actually also building the structure for the fundraiser on Meta. We will need people who help to design buttons, translate texts of buttons, documents, sitenotices etc. Should you feel you want to co-operate please let me know. You can reach me on my meta user page or by e-mail at scretella (at) wikimedia (dot) org. If you wish to notify us that you would like to co-operate on translations, it would be nice if you used e-mail and copied the e-mail to me and Aphaia (aphaia (at) gmail (dot) com). Thank you for your attention and I hope to meet you soon! Cheers :-) -- 4 September 2007 Sabine\n Please post this to your village pump.\nBetawiki: better support for your language in MediaWiki.\nDear community. I am writing to you to promote a special wiki called Betawiki. This wiki facilitates the localisation (l10n) of the MediaWiki interface. You may have changed many messages here to use your language in the interface, but if you would log in to for example the Japanese language Wiktionary, you would not be able to use the interface as well translated as here. In fact, of over 1,700 messages in the core of MediaWiki, 70 messages have been translated. Betawiki also supports the translation of messages for well over 100 extensions, with over 1,550 messages. Translators for over 70 languages contribute their work to MediaWiki this way every month.\nIf you wish to contribute to better support of your language in MediaWiki, as well as for many MediaWiki extensions, please visit Betawiki, create an account and request translator privileges.

I would just like to ask for two things. one Is there a maori version of the wikipedia logo, and two is there a place to get articles translated, such as which was requeted to maori translation on en.wikipedia.Blacksmith 07:55, 15 Mahuru 2007 (UTC)\nKia ora Blacksmith. Yes, there is a M\u0101ori version of the Wikipedia logo. We are waiting for it to be loaded, but these things take time to happen - a long time apparently, Wikipedia is just a volunteer thing, and changing logos seems to be hard to get done. Regarding the translation of 'Scouting New Zealand', no, we don't have a translation service, all we can do is ask on this page, which you have done. I didn't know that a request had been made on en.Wikipedia for that article to be translated - I thought they had asked about getting the words Scouting New Zealand translated - again, it is no good getting just anyone to translate something like that, Scouting New Zealand needs to get an official translation done by experts (it is strange that they have never done that). The M\u0101ori Language Commission are the people to ask for such a thing if that is what you are meaning. Email for the MLC is here, use the general email address for inquiries. Kahuroa 10:37, 15 Mahuru 2007 (UTC)\nTiwho.\nKia ora, I apologize for writing in English, but I don't speak M\u0101ori...\nI am looking for any information on the maori firstname tiwho. Does tiwho mean something? What would the translation be? Can you tell me anything on the origin of this firstname?\nThank you in advance for your answers, and best regards from your antipodes!\nYours, Herv\u00e9.\n:En compl\u00e9ment, et en m'excusant \u00e0 mon tour d'utiliser d'une autre langue, une personne a pos\u00e9 une question sur le sens du nom \u00ab tiwho \u00bb sur cette page de Wikipedia-FR.

Muchas gracias por adelante. Herv\u00e9.\nTiwho - ce n'est pas un nom M\u0101ori. The combination of letters wh+o is impossible in M\u0101ori. That site is wrong. Regards Kahuroa 11:25, 16 Whiringa-\u0101-nuku 2007 (UTC)\nT\u0113n\u0101 Koe Herv\u00e9,\nThere is only one instance that i am aware of where who (pronounced similar to four in eng) is used. The word Whoatu (hoatu to most other reo) is used by some of us of Maniapoto and also those of Hikairo (formally part of Maniapoto), other than that i don't believe who is ever used. I do know of one of my t\u016bpuna, uncle , and also a family named Tiwha(all from Maniapoto). This could have been the proper name? There are many meanings for the word but i think in this instance it means dark and gloomy, which is almost always associated with feelings (i.e., sad, morbid). check ngata dictionary for other meanings.

There is no active bureaucrat on this wiki since several months. So as to facilitate steward granting of bot access, I'd like to suggest implementing the standard bot policy on this wiki. This involves creating a redirect to the page :Wikipedia:Karetao from :Wikipedia:Bot policy (which is already in place since long), and adding a line at :Wikipedia:Karetao noting that standard bot policy is used here. In particular, this policy allows automatic acceptance of known interlanguage linking bots, which form the vast majority of such requests. \nPlease read the text at m:Bot policy before commenting. If you object, please say so; it will be implemented in two weeks if there is no objection, since it is particularly written to streamline bot requests on wikis with little or no community interest in bot access requests, and/or no local bureaucrats handling such requests. Thanky you for listening and for you cooperation. --Purodha Blissenbach 08:05, 14 Pout\u016b-te-rangi 2008 (UTC)\n": {

    "Wikipedia:K\u014drero, P\u016branga 2004\nMacrons.\nWhat will the Maori Wikipedia's policy on spelling Maori words be? Particularly, how will we represent the long vowel sounds? The title of this page currently uses \u00f6 for the long o, which is fairly common on the internet. The Maori Language Commission, by contrast, prefers a macron, giving \u014d. That's the preferred method in print, it seems. Another possibility (more common in educational circles) is simply to write the vowel twice. \n:that leads to complications with compound words Robin Patterson 02:47, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)\nAs such, this page could be K\u00f6rero, K\u014drero, or Koorero.

We should probably establish which convention we'll be following now, when there are only a few articles - it'll be easier than going back and changing everything later. \nAny thoughts? -- Vardion 07:03, 12 Mar 2004 (UTC)\n:Parliament has occasionally used a double vowel but is now moving towards macrons, though not with 100% consistency. :Robin Patterson 22:50, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)\n:The reason why the diaeresis (eg: \u00f6)  is more used than the macron (eg: \u014d) on computers is due to historic reasons: several years ago computers didn't support unicode, and the 8bits encoding commonly used in English operating systems (be it iso-8859-1 or windows-1252) doesn't have any macron letter; the use of the diaeresis was simply the less bad choice possible.\n:However, if the correct usage (in print, when handwriting; what is defined by the language authorities) is to use the a macron, then macrons should be used here (things changed a lot, and while it wasn't possible to use a macron some years ago for most people, nowadays the majority of operating systems fully support unicode (at least for the letters involved here), wikipedia uses unicode encoding internally too, so it isn't a problem either, I think everybody should be able to see them on screen without problem; if the problem is typing, then the list of involved letters could be printed on the samll text displayed near the edit box of a page, so people can just copy and paste them if they haven't figured out how to type them directly on keyboard (Spanish wikipedia for example does that) Srtxg 14 Mar 2004\nMacrons are now the policy.\nAnyone is welcome to change diaeresis/umlauts to macrons, but some Maori websites still use and/or display diaeresis/umlauts (or nothing --see Ngai Tahu's main page, for example) and, despite the optimism noted above, not all displays render macrons properly (eg on mine at home, I can see them in the edit box but in the articles and sidebars every macronned character is just a rectangle), so I see no hurry to change. Use of macrons in all new material is pretty easy now that I have followed up on the Srtxg suggestion. Robin Patterson 23:03, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)\nPage names with macrons.\nTo minimise irritation caused by edits that contain macronless links intended to target pages with names that have macrons, and vice versa, it is desirable to create the page name with NO MACRONS first, then MOVE it to the fully-macronned version. That leaves the plain version as an automatic Redirect (and a handy target for interwiki links), while the real article will be named in the officially-approved manner. We had a few of these moves in previous months. (If one creates the macronned page first, it's possible but much more fiddly to create a plain one as a Redirect.) \nThe above, now that I have fully worked it out and explained the reasons, will explain some of my recent flurry of creations and moves!

Robin Patterson 02:27, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)\nIMAGES - how do we copy images from other Wikipedias into this one? (I really have tried to find out, by studying at least a dozen pages about images!) Robin Patterson 02:27, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n:A frequently asked question (it should be added to a FAQ somewhere really). It is not currently possible to move images between Wikipedias. You have to download the image to your own computer (often right clicking on it will give you this option), and then re-upload that to the Wikipedia you want the image to be copied to. It's best to copy images that have some sort of source mentioned, or that state that are released under the GFDL, or are public domain. Add interlanguage links between the two so that if one is found to be a copyright violation, the other one can be deleted as well. There are plans for the future for all images to be on one site to save having to upload them separately to each Wikipedia. Angela 02:14, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n Thank you, Angela. I've copied that to a reasonably suitable place here for wider dissemination. - Robin\nProgress.\nKia ora koutou! Progress and thoughts following Anzac Day 2004 (and please feel free to add indented comments (ie starting with a colon) to any of these paragraphs!):\nYou'll have noticed that I haven't lost interest in this project. Annoyed with myself for not finishing that Administrators list - I seem to have been distracted then deleted that window after carelessly leaving it with quite a lot more composed and previewed. <strike>If I don't finish it soon, maybe someone else will - it needs only three more sysops to be named and should have Brion listed among the others.</strike>\nPlanning to create numerous lists (r\u0101rangi) pages, including a list of lists (!) and things like colours - (r\u0101rangi kano) - and months - (r\u0101rangi marama) (I hope those are right - see below) so as to make the contribution of one or two words at a time easy for those of us who speak hardly any M\u0101ori and can read only a little more. Some of them will be tables, with M\u0101ori words listed in alpha order and English equivalents opposite.\nI think we need a separate page for agreed styles (preferably with a proper M\u0101ori name - any offers?). Maybe it could start with a link to the English style page and say we follow that except for the following specific points, either of difference or where the English one has no equivalent (eg macrons).\nAnother small machinery matter is how we deal with having variants of words, eg Maori and M\u0101ori and maori. Obviously [?] our article would be under the preferred heading, with redirects from the other[s] so that the less skilled writers can link their variant even if they don't pick the preferred one - but those of you with experience in other Wikipedias may be able to steer me in a better direction there! The problem would arise whenever we got an expert opinion saying one of our page titles wasn't good M\u0101ori; but I guess moving or renaming is the way to do that; I hope we get some expert speakers soon, so as not to have to change too much.\nIt would be neat if anyone reading this page could add a Hello or Kia ora line at the bottom just to give us some idea whether anyone's reading it all!\nThat's all I can think of for now. If replying to any of these paras, please feel free to move them up or down to old or new headings as appropriate, for easier following of the sense and thread. Kind regards -  Robin Patterson 10:02, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n Milestone - more than 50 articles, so when you click on Long pages you no longer see the shortest page! (Now can someone else add a few dozen names of NZ Governors to R\u0101rangi K\u0101wana?) - Robin Patterson 22:30, 25 May 2004 (UTC)\nRelevant articles in the English Wikipedia.\nJust thought I should include a link to User:A Pakeha's contribution Wikipedia:Wikipedia English Language articles about Maori subjects so's we don't forget what a valuable resource it is.  - Robin, 27 April.\nUsage of English.\nWhy is it we use English so much here? Not in Korero, where it is understandable (for the moment), but in individual pages? If somebody speaks Maori, they'll be able to read and understand a request for them to help with mi:, otherwise they're probably at the wrong place and can click on English in the list of other languages. No MediaWiki messages should have any English, nor should the main page. The only places where English should be permitted is userpages, talkpages, and (possibly) text explaining external links. :en:List of Animals, if it exists (I'm not sure it does), doesn't give Maori translations. The fact that the Maori equivalent gives English translations for each word implies to me that the author of the page is of the POV that the English names for these animals are somehow relevant, which they aren't.\nIn addition, what's all this about being PURPOSEFULLY Aotearoa-centric? (I'm referring to the stuff about primarily about... in articles explaining Wikipedia) It's understandable to have a concentration of articles about New Zealand and especially about Maori-related topics (that's the case with most Wikipedias), but we should strive to be international and nothing-centric (except perhaps Earth-centric). en: obviously has a concentration of articles about American and Commonwealth-related topics, as does fr: with articles about France and Francophonie in general, but both strive to lower that concentration by increasing their repertoire of articles about other cultures and nations. To condone and even support such a concentration is against the spirit of Wikipedia. As is the case with all Wikipedias, it is the hope of all Wikipedians that all the articles in any given Wikipedia that only occur in that Wikipedia be translated so they can be included in all other Wikipedias. If that were to happen for all such articles right now, most Wikipedias would be fairly nothing-centric, though of course there would be slight bias towards first English, then German, French, Japanese.\n--24.251.242.236 04:11, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)\n:Kia ora, e manuhiri. I look forward to seeing your first 70 articles (preferably in fluent or even passable Maori, so as to be better than my first 70), and I'm happy to see you cover the whole world. I recommend that you start by attacking most of the red links on Hau K\u0101inga. Then you and your friends can work on your idea (which I agree with) that it is the hope of all Wikipedians that all the articles in any given Wikipedia that only occur in that Wikipedia be translated so they can be included in all other Wikipedias - translating 300,000 articles from en into mi.

    "Your condescention is noted and ignored. If you agree with that idea, which is actually central to Wikipedia policy and goals, then why does Wikipedia:Community Portal say that mi: is intended to have a concentration of local topics?\nIt says that because I'm trying to encourage Maori speakers to realise that they are most welcome to write about something familiar. I'll remove it when it's done that. Robin Patterson 20:37, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)\nThe point of Wikipedia is generally accepted to be quality rather than quantity, though in some cases people get carried away (take for example all the US placenames with only rudimentary census information which was added by bot). Thus, rather than working towards 70 articles which you yourself claim to be in poor Maori (and stubs, at that), \nperhaps you could find a Maori friend and have them help you translate or write one whole quality article from scratch?\nI don't have Maori friends who are interested yet; I have approached Maori Television and the Maori Language Commission and a community newsletter and a couple of tribal websites, with more of that planned; one day it may inspire someone to become active. Robin Patterson 20:37, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)\nThis is generally how successful new Wikipedias start, and if people don't do it that way, when fluent speakers do come they're often discouraged by the mess that's already been created by non-fluent speakers.\nIf you want to practice Maori, maybe you can do that on Korero, but generally Wikipedia policy frowns on editing just to practice your language skills rather than to actually contribute coherent content (though en:, de:, and fr: are now generally accepting of crappy English/German/French because of the wealth of native speakers who will fix it on sight). \nNon-fluents have started Wikipedias and made Main Pages, but to get very far beyond that with any degree of success has thus far required a native speaker. (for example a non-fluent started sc:, and recruited the first native speaker for fo:; obviously they tried their best for the mainpage at sc: and did extremely minimal interface translation; Merovingian did the same for mg: and I believe quite a few other Wikipedias have been started that way)\nIn addition, you didn't respond to many of my questions. Also, since you're the sysop, why don't you fix all the interface messages which use diereses (or is it dieresises?) instead of macrons?\nI don't have much spare time; some of your questions were interesting but I didn't have a good answer; I have at present better things to do than fix any diaeresis[?!} - they work AND are still used on many full Maori websites Robin Patterson 20:37, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)\nI also noticed that at the category page you mention that categories aren't nessecarily needed. This was already discussed before the recent implementation of categories, and most agreed that while they were not absolutely nessecary, they were definitely a useful feature. If you meant that they aren't the first priority in getting mi: up and running, then I definitely agree with you there.\nAlso, I noticed that you advertise for your own webpage in one of the system messages (the one about categories). It's generally accepted as policy that while one may add relevant links to normal articles and talk pages, and come very close to advertising (ie only semi-relevant links to sites of ones own) on talk pages, and resort to blatant commercialism on one's own userpage, linking in such a way in the Wikipedia: or MediaWiki: namespace is generally frowned upon.\nIf you sincerely believe that this should be a bilingual Wikipedia until more native speakers come, that's fine with me, but I continue to disagree. As I said before, using English and other non-Maori languages in talkpages and for things you don't know how to translate yourself is fine, but when you resort to having bilingual system messages and a partially or completely bilingual mainpage (in addition to, say, your list of animals), that generally discourages native speakers from editing because it seems less like an effort to build a true Maori Wikipedia at first glance.\nOver 99% of Maori speakers understand English perfectly well, often better than they understand Maori. The bilingual instructions will help them all to navigate and work out how to contribute. Robin Patterson 20:37, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)\nAs I said before, people who wish to edit here but have limited Maori can visit Community Portal or Korero, and if they are simply interested in the Wikipedia project itself, they can click the link on te Hau K\u0101inga to the Wikipedia in their language of choice (including Te Reo Tiamana, Te Reo Wiwi, *and*  Te Reo Ingarihi).\nYou may not appreciate my criticisms, and normally I would not expect you to take this sort of criticism, but you are currently the sole sysop on mi: (well, the sole sysop that knows anything better than kia ora) and as such it's YOUR job to fix problems and deal with people's complaints until you can recruit more sysops.\nIt is a bit of a burden. I didn't ask to be a sysop. The good folk who started this off (including those whose Maori is almost certainly better than mine) have virtually left it alone. But, as indicated in a couple of replies above, I'm happy to address perceived problems. I think I have responded as positively as possible to every newcomer who has contributed anything. Robin Patterson 20:37, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)\n:Re: it's YOUR job to... - it's no one's job to do anything on a volunteer project. I suggest you stop criticising the work of other people if you have nothing constructive to contribute yourself. Also, if you want to have a conversation with Robin, I think his talk page would be a better place to do that rather than the K\u00f6rero. Angela\nAs to me editing articles in Maori: I do not wish to mess up mi: with my poor Maori. I do have a friend who may be willing to edit, though I think he'd be a lot more likely if mi: wasn't transparently bilingual.\nI have been thinking of removing more of the English from Hau K\u0101inga now that I've created the Community Portal for people who have little or no Maori. Maybe I'll do that in a week or two if nobody comes and disagrees. Thanks. Robin Patterson 20:37, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)\nPLEASE ASK YOUR FRIEND to have a go!!!  He or she may like to start with a look at this  Wikipedia:Wikipedia English Language articles about Maori subjects Robin Patterson 20:37, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)\nI did. He said that it looked like it was only partially in Maori, and that he'd think about contributing later when it looked better. I asked him what he meant by better, and he said he meant when it looked more Maori. My friend *is* familiar with Wikipedia (though I don't think he's done more than a small bit of editing on en:); what you said about Maori bilingualism is true (in fact, I was under the impression that well over 99% of Maori speakers were bilingual), however the enthusiasm of a new user who's thinking of contributing is probably much dampened by the over-abundance of English on even the Main Page, but many system messages as well.\nAlso, while diereses do work, it's been decided *on this page* that we are to use macrons instead. If for some reason I'm wrong about that, you could at least change the system messages that currently use macrons so that they use diereses instead so that it's at least consistent.\nAs to the folks who started this Wikipedia - I'm not sure if you're aware, but the start of mi: is shrouded in scandal, many assert that Perl only started it because he wanted to be a sysop at as many projects as possible. The only Maori he knew he got from an online dictionary, which is where the original interface translations came from. I personally would've started it myself had it not already been started (though I would've used macrons from the beginning, and I'd not've done so much of the user interface without the opinion of at least somebody who has studied a little Maori instead of using a dictionary alone; I also wouldn'tve requested sysophood like he did), as the other couple of Wikipedias I've started testify to.\nAs to advertising, I have noted at least one instance of a link to your zonk site in the Wikipedia: or MediaWiki: namespace. It's fine in talk pages, and even on pages on the article namespace where it's a relevant link, but for an article in the Wikipedia: namespace it's generally unacceptable. Whether or not it's commercial is not relevant; it is obviously a website that you are affiliated with.\nMoved the offending material to MediaWiki talk:Category (and explained its value) - incidentally, I'm more affiliated with Wikipedia than with Zeal in terms of time spent in the last 6 months. Robin Patterson 23:03, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)\nAnd thanks for replying so soon. Please ask your friend to have another go, translating anything he or she wants to on article pages and Hau K\u0101inga, so as to reduce the proportion of English. Robin Patterson 23:03, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)\nWell, nearly 4 weeks later, the anonymous contributor hasn't responded to my request that he or she tell me what else specifically needs fixing. I did fix some of the links that used diaereses instead of macrons, so now there's a bit more that I can't read on my home computer - and other users may have the same problem. Apart from that, I've just gone on occasionally adding a few articles per week, almost exclusively in M\u0101ori, and removing some of the English here and there. Noted with pleasure that many of our pages come up on general web searches for specific page names. By way of personal interest, I'm creating a page listing articles that have received significant input from people who know more M\u0101ori than I do. I hope most of those contributors come back and continue the improvements. If I've omitted a contribution one of them thinks should be listed, he or she can add it.

See :de:MediaWiki:Copyrightwarning for an example. Angela 20:42, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)\nAngela, you are worth your weight in gold. I've attended to that, thank you. I added the stub message code to the box of characters, to save even more time - someone may now tell me what M\u0101ori wording would be best in the actual stub message!  Robin Patterson 02:27, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)\nProgress - clickable macrons from metawikipedia.\nNg\u0101 tohut\u014d just by clicking. Hooray! (I had to edit MediaWiki:Copyrightwarning, of course).  Robin Patterson 00:31, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)\nImages.\nHow do we copy images from other Wikipedias into this one? (I really have tried to find out, by studying at least a dozen pages about images!) Robin Patterson 02:27, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n:A frequently asked question (it should be added to a FAQ somewhere really). It is not currently possible to move images between Wikipedias. You have to download the image to your own computer (often right clicking on it will give you this option), and then re-upload that to the Wikipedia you want the image to be copied to. It's best to copy images that have some sort of source mentioned, or that state that are released under the GFDL, or are public domain. Add interlanguage links between the two so that if one is found to be a copyright violation, the other one can be deleted as well. There are plans for the future for all images to be on one site to save having to upload them separately to each Wikipedia. Angela 02:14, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n Thank you, Angela. I've copied that to a reasonably suitable place here for wider dissemination. - Robin\nImages progress since Sep 2004.\nSee COMMONS - Robin Patterson 00:31, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)\nTemplates.\nStub message.\n<strike>Do we have a M\u0101ori equivalent of:\n that says something meaningful?</strike>\n:Robin Patterson 06:46, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)\n - We do now; I worked THAT one out all by myself Robin Patterson 12:33, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n and, of course, you no longer need the msg: part; so just stub inside those curly brackets will produce the M\u0101ori and English message with lines above and below. Robin Patterson 20:13, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)\nWelcome templates.\nHaving finally plucked up courage to create a personal message template on another wiki and seen how easy it is, I'm going to create one here. Anyone (I expect) will be able to use it (just enclosing welc1 in double curly brackets, same as for the stub message) and any user may create a close equivalent or totally separate one. Beware! - if you ever revise a template (or someone else does), it will appear in its new form on all previously-applied pages where it still resides, and the new wording may not fit with what was on them, eg if you started off without a concluding Enjoy and added that word manually, the word will appear twice for those recipients if you then add the word into your template; so keep an eye on such a template if you do create one.

Progress and thoughts following Anzac Day 2004 (and please feel free to add indented comments (ie starting with a colon) to any of these paragraphs!):\nYou'll have noticed that I haven't lost interest in this project. Annoyed with myself for not finishing that Administrators list - I seem to have been distracted then deleted that window after carelessly leaving it with quite a lot more composed and previewed. <strike>If I don't finish it soon, maybe someone else will - it needs only three more sysops to be named and should have Brion listed among the others.</strike>\nPlanning to create numerous lists (r\u0101rangi) pages, including a list of lists (!) and things like colours - (r\u0101rangi kano) - and months - (r\u0101rangi marama) (I hope those are right - see below) so as to make the contribution of one or two words at a time easy for those of us who speak hardly any M\u0101ori and can read only a little more. Some of them will be tables, with M\u0101ori words listed in alpha order and English equivalents opposite.\nI think we need a separate page for agreed styles (preferably with a proper M\u0101ori name - any offers?). Maybe it could start with a link to the English style page and say we follow that except for the following specific points, either of difference or where the English one has no equivalent (eg macrons).\nAnother small machinery matter is how we deal with having variants of words, eg Maori and M\u0101ori and maori. Obviously [?] our article would be under the preferred heading, with redirects from the other[s] so that the less skilled writers can link their variant even if they don't pick the preferred one - but those of you with experience in other Wikipedias may be able to steer me in a better direction there! The problem would arise whenever we got an expert opinion saying one of our page titles wasn't good M\u0101ori; but I guess moving or renaming is the way to do that; I hope we get some expert speakers soon, so as not to have to change too much.\nIt would be neat if anyone reading this page could add a Hello or Kia ora line at the bottom just to give us some idea whether anyone's reading it all!\nThat's all I can think of for now. If replying to any of these paras, please feel free to move them up or down to old or new headings as appropriate, for easier following of the sense and thread.

Robin Patterson 00:42, 12 Kohi-t\u0101tea 2006 (UTC)\n 1. for the (Move) page link near the top of every page, we have Whakakori  - this is wrong, why? Because although whakakori does mean move it is not the kind of moving that is intended here. Whakakori has to do with the movements or  wrigglings of a person or animal.  Whakakori does not mean 'move' in the sense of relocate or shift (a page). Rather it means move in the sense move/wriggle/exercise your body. I'd suggest Nekehia which means move in the sense  of relocate. It is a passive so you don't need any other words with it to give the right sense.\n:Ka pai. Robin Patterson 00:42, 12 Kohi-t\u0101tea 2006 (UTC)\n 2. The Macron picklist at bottom of page has the text \u0112tahi p\u016b-N\u0100NA I KAPE (copy or click as required). This makes no sense because in Te Reo it means Certain letters - HE COPIED IT. I'd suggest changing it to the more elegant He tohu whakahua kupu: m\u0101u e kape, e p\u0101whiri r\u0101nei  which means Accented letters - for you copy or click on. Literally marks for the pronunciation of words - you may copy (them), or you may click (on them).\n:Only one quibble - the full list is more than accented letters, eg it has useful things such as N-dash and double-bracket pairs. Robin Patterson 00:42, 12 Kohi-t\u0101tea 2006 (UTC)\n 3. For (Watch) this page we have Puri turanga which is wrong because puri  rarely appears without duplication, it should be Pupuri t\u016branga  - this is a compound meaning something like keep your position; but I would suggest Tiakina which means keep a watch - another possibility is Kia hiwa - be watchful. But I like Tiakina with its overtones of keeping a protective eye on something.\n:Tiakina? - but then I read Z's comment. Robin Patterson 00:42, 12 Kohi-t\u0101tea 2006 (UTC)\n 4. (Talk)/discuss this page - we have K\u014drero t\u0113nei hau. This is bad grammar because k\u014drero requires the particle i to come between it and t\u0113nei. (Unlike the phrase in point 3, this is not a compound because it includes t\u0113nei and so must have a particle). Failing i, you can use m\u014d after k\u014drero to give the meaning speak about. You must have something between it and a noun - if you know any languages with cases like Latin or German, i is one of the particles that mark the accusative case, and leaving it out is like having a noun in the nominative instead of the accusative after a verb. \n Another point is that k\u014drero means talk in the sense more of say/tell.  So K\u014drero t\u0113nei hau means Say this hau although because the particle is missing it looks like a defective Ka k\u014drero t\u0113nei hau  - This hau speaks. The correct word for talk about/discuss is K\u014drerorero which implies a group activity of discussion, and I'd suggest the passive form K\u014drerorerotia which gives the sense without requiring any particles or nouns to follow it. Also, hau is a bit vague.  K\u014drerorerotia is all you need. Kahuroa 09:57, 10 Kohi-t\u0101tea 2006 (UTC)\n:Ka pai. Robin Patterson 19:17, 26 Kohi-t\u0101tea 2006 (UTC)\n:I had been banging my head between various references trying to work out similar candidates for the short messages, and why an unadorned k\u014drero was used in so many places.  I edited the local system messages for 1 & 2 according to your suggestions.\n:I agree with your reasoning about Watch, but tiakina seems to be associated with saving a file (according to the Microsoft Community Glossary), perhaps as in safe-guarding.  Watch is an abbreviated multilayered compromise describing the software feature.  Other possible concepts include remembering, noting, listing, adopting, and guarding (but not protecting).\n:Would K\u014drerorerotia be a better title for this page, being primarily group discussion?  And would k\u014drerom\u014d be better for talk about (this page) / talk to (this user)?\n:- Zigger 20:13, 11 Kohi-t\u0101tea 2006 (UTC)\n:Apology for the bad grammar. I put the extra two words in a long time ago to distinguish from the K\u014drero page (which has had several names). Now that we are about to get a better name for it, that distinction (even with proper grammar) may be unnecessary. I think Zigger and Kahuroa can continue the dialogue without me, and tomorrow morning the process will probably be even easier. Robin Patterson 00:42, 12 Kohi-t\u0101tea 2006 (UTC)\nSomeone's an early riser! More good-looking ideas appearing at various times of day. I shouldn't have had an evening off.\nMaybe it's time for separate pages to discuss some of these except where they clearly relate?\nK\u014drero mai is a nice idea for user-talk but I have a feeling we can't have a different one for other types of talk pages. So K\u014drero m\u014d te wh\u0101rangi for all, maybe?\nFor this page - have a look at the top paragraphs.\nRobin Patterson 19:20, 12 Kohi-t\u0101tea 2006 (UTC)\n Link tabs on the top of articles, K\u014drero page.\nI decided to wipe some of my previous comments on these, because I have had a rethink and it would have been too confusing to leave the other stuff here - confusing for me at least anyway! Kahuroa\n:Ah, that may explain what look like unsigned paragraphs above; anyway, good idea collecting remainder here. Robin Patterson 21:33, 26 Kohi-t\u0101tea 2006 (UTC)\n Yeah, that'll be me Kahuroa 07:23, 27 Kohi-t\u0101tea 2006 (UTC)\nWikipedia english: discussion - miWiki presently k\u014drero t\u0113nei hau.\n(problem: ungrammatical)\n:K\u014drerorero - Robin Patterson 21:33, 26 Kohi-t\u0101tea 2006 (UTC)\n Yeah, K\u014drerorero is appropriate.

My other suggestion would be: \n:I have toyed with the idea of suggesting Hui hapori, but that's just a phrase I concocted. Robin Patterson 21:33, 26 Kohi-t\u0101tea 2006 (UTC)\ndiacritics, accented letters, other symbols to click or copy.\nRe the diacritics and Robin's point that there are more than just accented letters. How about just adding a bit to cover that:\nHe p\u016b, he tohu whakahua kupu: m\u0101u e kape, e p\u0101whiri r\u0101nei  . Kahuroa 04:52, 17 Kohi-t\u0101tea 2006 (UTC)\n:Maybe unnecessarily long? - omit whakahua kupu, perhaps? - with or without accents, all are p\u016b and/or tohu; and whatever they are is displayed immediately after. Robin Patterson 21:33, 26 Kohi-t\u0101tea 2006 (UTC)\n I agree it is long, but 'tohu whakahua kupu' is one of the rare examples on the site of phrases with a nice idiomatic feel to them. 'Tohu' on its own has a very wide semantic field - can mean a lot of things, including omen etc, so if we could retain it that would be good. Maybe 'he p\u016b' is somewhat more dispensible since methinks that p\u016b as meaning 'letter' is more of a dictionary term rather than one speakers of the language would understand at sight.

    " Any further discussion.\nOn these points discussed above? Kahuroa 10:48, 26 Kohi-t\u0101tea 2006 (UTC)\nMain Page redesign.\nI have on my user page a mockup of my proposed new version of the main page. Since I translated some of the text into M\u0101ori the page has looked particularly ugly, so I had a go at a redesign. I thought we needed some more colour on the page as well, and to reduce how much space is taken up by the long lists. I have included all the info and links on the current page, plus put some English fairly prominently to acknowledge the input of English speakers so far.

Reed Pocket Dictionary has 1,000, 000 for miriona, with the space probably being a typo, and it offers ira tekau for decimal point (ira being defined as a dot, among other things, not a comma).

I'm an admin user in the basque wikipedia (eu) and I have the bot flag in more than 80 wikipedias.

I see you have contacted Robin Patterson for approval - unfortunately the community here asked Robin Patterson in November to cease his involvement with this Wiki, which he has basically respected until now. Have you approached any of the other bureaucrats? I have approached :en:User:Vardion. Kahuroa 21:05, 13 Paenga-wh\u0101wh\u0101 2007 (UTC)\n:I can flag TXiKiBoT as a bot, assuming that it is the consensus of active users here. It would also be a good idea, I suppose, if someone who was active here became a bureaucrat, too - I'm not around here very often (my only real involvement here was in the early stages in an attempt to get things started, and even then, my knowledge of the language was too low for me to contribute much). In the meantime, though, I'll do what's asked - is there consensus that TXiKiBoT should be flagged as a bot? -- Vardion 01:44, 14 Paenga-wh\u0101wh\u0101 2007 (UTC)\n::It was me who asked Robin to flag this as a bot. I am not active much here now days, as we have got to a stage where Kahuroa has improved this wiki to a better stage of M\u0101ori language. \n::Kahuroa, I asked as I was not aware of that, and only asked him because he is a bureaucrat, and the only one I knew to have been active here. I check the RC most days for spam, and vandalism, and I feel a bot flag for this active bot will make life easier. Heoi an\u014d; n\u0101 Brian  (talk) 04:26, 14 Paenga-wh\u0101wh\u0101 2007 (UTC)\n:::Well I have wanted to flag the bots for some time too, and I have no objection to it being done, as long as the bot has been granted that status, and maintained it, on other wikis. I am the most (only) active user, there are one or two others who edit occasionally but their appearance is a bit erratic. As Vardion says, it would make sense if an active user was a bureaucrat too. Then the M\u0101ori wikipedia could be said to be standing on its own feet for the first time in its history. Kahuroa 00:21, 15 Paenga-wh\u0101wh\u0101 2007 (UTC)\n::::Since there don't seem to be any objections, I've flagged TXiKiBoT as a bot.

    " Almabot.\nHello, I would like to request the flag for my bot:\nThanks in advance. Nakor 18:19, 27 Hune 2009 (UTC)\nBot policy.\nHello. To facilitate steward granting of bot access, I suggest implementing the standard bot policy on this wiki. In particular, this policy allows stewards to automatically flag known interlanguage linking bots (if this page says that is acceptable), which form the vast majority of such requests. The policy also enables global bots on this wiki (if this page says that is acceptable), which are trusted bots that will be given bot access on every wiki that allows global bots.\nThis policy makes bot access requesting much easier for local users, operators, and stewards. To implement it we only need to create a redirect to this page from Project:Bot policy, and add a line at the top noting that it is used here. Please read the text at m:Bot policy before commenting. If you object, please say so; I hope to implement in one week if there is no objection, since it is particularly written to streamline bot requests on wikis with little or no community interested in bot access requests.
