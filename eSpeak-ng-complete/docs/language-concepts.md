### [IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet)

An alphabetic system of phonetic notation. Designed to represent qualities of speech that are part of lexical (and to a limited extent prosodic) sounds in oral language: phones, phonemes, intonation and the separation of words and syllables.

### [Phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_(phonetics))

Any distinct speech sound or gesture. Language and word-meaning independent. Generally vowels or consonants.

A phonetic transcription (based on phones) is enclosed with square brackets ([ ]).

### [Phoneme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme)

A unit of sound that distinguishes one word from another in a particular language. Can also be though of as a sound pattern.

A phonemic transcription (based on phonemes) is enclosed with slashes (/ /).

### [Vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel)

A phone that is produced without any stricture in the vocal tract. A good way to think of it is as a frictionless, continuous sound - you can keep making the sound forever.

### [Consonant]()

A speech sound that is articulateed with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. For example, \[p\] is  pronounced with the lips, \[t\] with the front of the toungue. The sound cannot be produced continuously.

### [Syllable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable)

A unit of organization for a sequence of phones. It is typically made up of a syllable nucleus (most often a vowel) with optional initial and final margins (typically, consonants). Syllables are often considered the phonological "building blocks" of words.

In the IPA, a period (.) is used to mark syllable breaks. E.g. in the word "astronomical" ⟨/ˌæs.trəˈnɒm.ɪk.əl/⟩.
