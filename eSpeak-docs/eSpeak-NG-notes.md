# Phoneme Selection Validation

**R phoneme**

- R has been selected
- R2 phoneme had an unsatisfactory tap at the end of the pronounciation.
- The trill on R3 was too soft
- The r" phoneme was too long, and sounded clunky

**N phoneme**
[n] is inaudible when pronounced at the start of a clause. But when within a word it sounds fine.

- n. had little discernable difference, except was possibly less clear in cases where n was audible
- n^ sounded *much* better in instances where [n] was inaudible. However, in other cases it sounded distinctly non-Maori
