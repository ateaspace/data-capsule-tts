Current Status: Building espeakedit-ng

GTK+ build issue - fails to generate gdk/gdkresources.c due to symbol lookup error: undefined symbol: g_task_set_name
=====
Resolution: point compiler towards x86_64 libraries
=====

GDK-PIXBUF build issue - Fails to load and parse external entity "http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/manpages/docbook.xsl"
=====
Possible bandaid fix - disable man page building

+ make, cmake m4, autoconf, automake, libtool, pkg-config zlib, python3, meson, ninja -> failed, needs glib
+ libffi, glib -> failure, needs image handling libraries
+ libpng, libjpeg, libtiff -> failure, needs shared-mime-info
+ libxml, itstool, xmlto, shared-mime-info -> failed
- xmlto -> success

Conclusion: xmlto is causing issues
Speculative fix: Remove xmlto from the build pipeline, as shared-mime-info is the only package that depends on it
Status: Partial fix. Works on some builds and not others. Using bandaid fix
=====

DBUS build issue
=====
Debug steps: Cumulatively add in packages from the pipeline until we get a build failure

+ make, m4, autoconf, automake, libtool, python3 -> failure, python needs zlib
+ zlib -> success
+ python2, python3 -> success
+ openssl -> success
+ libxml -> success
+ itstool, xmlto -> failure, build issue hit
- xmlto -> success

Conclusion: xmlto is causing issues
Speculative fix: Place xmlto in custom prefix
Status: Resolved
=====
